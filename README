The Slovenian UD Treebank is based on the ssj500k treebank (Krek and Erjavec 2014), a representative and balanced collection of sampled texts from the reference FidaPLUS corpus of written Slovenian (Arhar and Gorjanc 2007) that have been manually segmented, tokenized, lemmatized and morphosyntactically tagged in accordance with the JOS annotation scheme (Erjavec et al. 2010). Approximately one half of the ssj500k corpus also includes manually annotated dependency relations which is the what has been used as the basis for the Slovene UD Treebank.

The Slovenian UD Treebank thus includes 11.411 sentences with 235.864 tokens taken from a variety of text genres, such as fiction, non-fiction and periodicals, dating from 1990-2000. The first version of the Slovene UD Treebank (not yet officially released) conforms to the general tokenization and formatting principles and currently includes automatic conversions of part-of-speech categories and features that have been described in the corresponding Slovenian UD Guidelines. Further revisions of this work and syntactic mapping remains a work in progress.
